# JaipurEmulator
Emulates the game (by default the screen is cleared after every action is run, so that the other player does not see your hand).



## Rules of the game Jaipur
1.

# Use instructions
## CLI exec
Only accepts one action per call
- The windows executable assumes that msys2 is installed. More concretely, it assumes that reset.exe (from Unix) is found in the PATH. If it is not, it might not be possible to run the executable.

## Julia

## To do
### v1.0.1 of emulator
(Ship library before this)
- Change paradigm so that you can just call the exe once and loop over the turns. Will need loading, new game and saving game. 
- File names will need a bigger buffer probably, and fixed max length.
